# Patchwork Isles

**Tag/Trait-driven narrative engine for weaving political intrigue across a living archipelago.**

> _Gameplay screenshot coming soon._

## Controls at a Glance
- Type the number or letter shown next to a choice and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to advance the story.
- Enter `i` at any prompt to view your current tags, traits, inventory, and faction reputation.
- Enter `o` to open the Options screen for audio, display, and UI scale settings.
- Enter `h` to review the last few story beats, or `q` to quit to the title screen and optionally save.

## Quick Start
1. **Install Python 3.8 or newer.** The engine is pure Python with no third-party dependencies required for runtime.
2. **Clone the repo and enter the folder.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/Patchwork-Isles.git
   cd Patchwork-Isles
   ```
3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install development tools (ruff, black, mypy, Pillow for placeholder art).**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   > If you only want to play, you can skip installing dev tools.
5. **Run the engine.**
   ```bash
   python engine/engine_min.py world/world.json
   ```
6. **Validate content before committing changes.**
   ```bash
   python tools/validate.py
   ```

## Authoring Quick Reference
- **Gate a choice by Tag:**
  ```json
  "condition": {"type": "has_tag", "value": "Sneaky"}
  ```
- **Require multiple Tags (ALL-of):**
  ```json
  "condition": {"type": "has_tag", "value": ["Weaver", "Diplomat"]}
  ```
- **Reward a Tag or Trait:**
  ```json
  {"type": "add_tag", "value": "Judge"}
  {"type": "add_trait", "value": "People-Reader"}
  ```
- **Use Reputation gates/rewards:**
  ```json
  "condition": {"type": "rep_at_least", "faction": "Root Court", "value": 1}
  {"type": "rep_delta", "faction": "Wind Choirs", "value": 1}
  ```
- **End the story:**
  ```json
  {"type": "end_game", "value": "Hidden Docks Escape"}
  ```
- **Unlock a new start:**
  1. Author the start entry in `world/world.json` with `locked: true`, a `locked_title`, and the destination `node`.
  2. Deliver the unlock via an `on_enter` reward node with `{ "type": "unlock_start", "value": "your_start_id" }`.
  3. Playtest the loop, run `python tools/validate.py`, and update any lists that track available origins.

> Always author at least one "tagless" path (e.g., trade an item or spend faction favor) so players are never hard-locked.
